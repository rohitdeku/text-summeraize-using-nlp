NBA had first partnered with Dream11 for the 2017-18 basketball season and launched the league's first official fantasy game in India.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough this tie-up, Indian consumers will be able to compete in a range of public and private NBA and WNBA-themed fantasy contests on Dream11 daily. They will get to build a virtual team of NBA or WNBA players and accumulate points based on the players&rsquo; real-life on-court performances. Users will be able to compete in both free and paid contests on the platform.\\r\\n\\r\\n&ldquo;With India being one of the fastest growing markets in the world for fantasy gaming, bolstering our presence in this space has been a key focus for us over the last few years,&rdquo; said NBA India Country Head Rajah Chaudhry.\\r\\n\\r\\n&ldquo;We have seen a significant increase in fan engagement since the launch of our official fantasy game on Dream11, and as we embark on this continued journey together, we look forward to pushing the boundaries of innovation in fantasy gaming and providing fans with even more exciting ways to connect with the NBA and WNBA,&rdquo; he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead:&nbsp;Fantasy Sports has led a drastic shift in sports engagement &amp;amp;amp; viewership: Dream Sports CEO Harsh Jain\\r\\n\\r\\nVikrant Mudaliar, Chief Marketing Officer, Dream11 said, &amp;quot;As we extend our collaboration with the NBA and WNBA, we&rsquo;re committed to taking the excitement of basketball to new heights for our users. This association underscores our dedication to the sport while also highlighting the limitless possibilities in the realm of fantasy gaming.&amp;quot;\\r\\n\\r\\nDream11 currently claims to have over 200 million users playing fantasy contests across various sports including cricket, football, kabaddi, basketball, hockey, and volleyball among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nDream Sports, the parent firm of fantasy sport major Dream11, saw its revenue from operations jump 66 percent to Rs 6,384.49 crore for the financial year 2023, from Rs 3,841 crore in FY22. Profit after tax grew by 32.4 percent to Rs 188 crore in FY23 from Rs 142 crore in FY22.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, concerns about the impact of an over Rs 28,000 crore show cause notice issued for alleged goods and services tax (GST) evasion and non-payment of 28 percent GST on the face value of bets has prompted the company's auditor to flag &amp;quot;a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on group's ability to continue as a going concern&amp;quot;.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian government also imposed a 28 percent&nbsp;GST regime on the country's real-money gaming sector, which became effective on October 1, 2023. The new tax rates are expected to hit the revenues and profitability of many companies in the sector.\",\n          \"To prevent instances of runway incursions at airports, aviation watchdog DGCA has asked stakeholders to put in place a runway safety team at all airports and adopt technologies to improve situational awareness, among other measures. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued a circular in view of the collision of planes due to runway incursion at the Haneda airport in Japan last month.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from establishing a runway safety team at all aerodromes and ensuring their effective functioning, the regulator has emphasised on comprehensive training for pilots, air traffic controllers, aircraft maintenance engineers, and drivers operating inside an airport. Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) should ensure that stop bars are switched on to signal a stop and switched off to indicate traffic may proceed. In no case, aircraft or vehicles be instructed to cross illuminated red stop bars, DGCA said in a release on Monday.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther, the watchdog said that aerodromes, ATCs and airlines should implement contingency measures to cater to unserviceable stop bars. Another recommendation is adoption of technological interventions to improve situational awareness, thereby assisting Air Traffic Control (ATC) and other stakeholders to identify the traffic within the manoeuvering area.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther recommendations include ensuring adherence to standard procedures by all involved personnel/stakeholders, and recognising the influence of human factors on performance, which may contribute to runway incursions. The rate of runway incursions are decreasing and by ensuring a proactive approach among all stakeholders, the risk of such incidents can be reduced further, according to DGCA.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a fatal incident on January 2, a large passenger plane and a Japanese coast guard aircraft collided on the runway at the Haneda airport and burst into flames. Five people onboard the plane of the coast guard were killed. The incident happened due to runway incursion by Japanese coast guard's DHC-8 aircraft when Japan Airlines aircraft was in the process of landing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the incident, DGCA undertook a review of its existing requirements and safety measures in place for runway safety and prevention of runway incursions. In August last year, a mishap was averted at the Delhi airport involving two Vistara planes as the air traffic controller inadvertently gave clearance for crossing and take off of two different aircraft on the same runway at the same time before cancelling the take off.\",\n          \"SpiceJet shares fell 4 percent on February 12 following reports that the low-cost airline would cut down the workforce by 10-15 percent to reduce fixed costs. The job-cuts will help the airline save around Rs 100 crore, CNBC TV18 reported, citing unidentified sources.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpiceJet has lined up more cost-saving measures to stay afloat in the coming months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Economic Times&nbsp;reported that approximately 1,400 SpiceJet employees are to be laid off. These layoffs are essential for aligning companywide costs with operational requirements, according to the report. The cash-strapped airline currently has 9,000-9,500 employees and bears a salary bill of Rs 60 crore.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpiceJet shares were trading 3.93 percent down at Rs 65.5 at 11.51 am on the National Stock Exchange. The shares have gained 94 percent in the last six months and 86 percent in the last one year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe airline currently operates 30 aircraft, 10 of which are wet-leased. The picture is very different as compared to 2019 where SpiceJet had a fleet of 118 planes and 16,000 employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe airline has been directed by the Delhi High Court to settle the outstanding dues amounting to $4 million it owed two engine lessors, by February 15. Failure to comply with the court's directive could result in adverse legal action, with the lessors expressing their intention to pursue litigation against the airline.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Zerodha said in its twitter handle, due to operational delays at the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), the commodity markets will open at 10am today. Meanwhile, markets traded marginally higher with the Sensex up 0.2 percent to 71,191 points. Shrey Jain, Founder amp;amp; CEO, SAS Online on MCX said brokers are awaiting position, margin and trade files from MCX without which processing of previous trading session is pending. Once files are received we will do the Beginning of Day process and prepare the system for today's trading. amp;nbsp;\""
